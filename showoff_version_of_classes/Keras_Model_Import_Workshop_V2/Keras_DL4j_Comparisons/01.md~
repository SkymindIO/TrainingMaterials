# Comparison of Keras and DL4J

!SLIDE

* Many similarities
* Build Neural Networks
* Build networks based on popular research or examples


!SLIDE

* Differences
* Keras is built on top of other modules
  * Tensorflow
  * Theano
  * SciPy, Numpy


!SLIDE

* Differences
* DL4J team built almost all parts of the framework
* ND4J custom built for INDArray operations to support Neural Networks
* DataVec built to support data ingestion for Neural Networks
* distributed Spark based functionality Built in

keras is an interface to a lower level framework that implements autodiff whereas we're a higher level framework with our own ETL, visualization tools,tensor library, and integrations with various streaming frameworks implemented on the JVM
tldr: keras is just "higher level math"

Skymind can build models like a data scientist and vendor support a whole software stack like a company


Add trained models and trainedmodelhelper
