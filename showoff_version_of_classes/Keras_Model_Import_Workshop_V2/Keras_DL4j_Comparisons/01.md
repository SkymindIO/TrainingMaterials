# Comparison of Keras and DL4J

!SLIDE

# Keras Strengths

* Wide adoption of Python by a number of communities
  * Data Science
  * Research
  * Academia
  

!SLIDE

# Keras Strengths continued...

* Python is replacing Java as the language taught in University
* REPL enables Notebooks and easy sharing

!SLIDE

# DeepLearning4j Strengths

* Java 
  * Wide use in traditional enterprise organizations
  * Stable and Secure
* Core Libraries purpose built for Neural Networks
  * DataVec for ETL
  * Nd4J for NDArrays, tensors, matrices
  * libnd4j for GPU/CPU native operations

# Comparisons Between DeepLearning4J and Keras

* The Stack
  * DL4J has purpose built full stack from ETL to Inference
  * Keras leverages other libraries for core functionality


!SLIDE

# Statically Typed vs Dynamically Typed

* Java
  * Statically Typed
* Python
  * Dynamically typed
* Statically  typed languages catch many errors at compile time rather than runtime

!SLIDE

# Distributed Training

* DL4J in Java fits in well with Hadoop/Spark


!SLIDE

# Security

* DL4j on Spark/Hadoop

!SLIDE

* Many similarities
* Build Neural Networks
* Build networks based on popular research or examples


!SLIDE

* Differences
* Keras is built on top of other modules
  * Tensorflow
  * Theano
  * SciPy, Numpy


!SLIDE

* Differences
* DL4J team built almost all parts of the framework
* ND4J custom built for INDArray operations to support Neural Networks
* DataVec built to support data ingestion for Neural Networks
* distributed Spark based functionality Built in

keras is an interface to a lower level framework that implements autodiff whereas we're a higher level framework with our own ETL, visualization tools,tensor library, and integrations with various streaming frameworks implemented on the JVM
tldr: keras is just "higher level math"

Skymind can build models like a data scientist and vendor support a whole software stack like a company


Add trained models and trainedmodelhelper
