# Lab Prep

1. Step One

```
git clone https://github.com/tomthetrainer/KerasWorkshop.git
```

2. Step two

Import the project into Intellij by following instructions at https://deeplearning4j.org/quickstart

3. Additional Resources

Two saved Keras Model for VGG-16 and the DL4J version are too large to put into github. 

Get them from the following url, this will only work while on Skymind's Wireless so download before you leave. 

vgg16.zip
vgg_combined_save.h5

The Labs expect those to be in the /tmp directory. Either place them there or modify the java code that refers to the file path.
