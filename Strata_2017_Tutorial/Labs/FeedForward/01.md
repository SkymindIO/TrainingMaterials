# Lab Step 1: 

Open Intellij and navigate to the Labs project. 

```src/main/java/ai.skymind.training/labs```


# Lab Step 3:

Set an int for Random Number Seed. Same seed with different runs allow for consistent results. 

```
int rngseed = 123;
Random randNumGen = new Random(rngseed);
```


# Lab Step 4:

Set Batchsize. Batchsize determines how many records to train on before adjusting weights. In this case we are classifying to 10 possible classes, our batchsize should be large enough and our data randomized to include records from each class in the batch. 

Add a line to set the batchsize. 

```
int batchSize = 128;
```


# Lab Step 5:

For Classification the number of nodes in the output layer is equal to the number of classes. 

Add this line to the code

```
int outputNum = 10;
```	 

# Lab Step 6:

An epoch is a total pass through the training data. Set numEpochs to 15

Add this line to the code

```
 int numEpochs = 15;
 ```	 

# Lab Step 7:

Add these two lines to define the paths to the train folder and the test folder

```
File trainData = new ClassPathResource("mnist_png/training").getFile();
File testData = new ClassPathResource("mnist_png/testing").getFile();
```
	 

# Lab Step 8:

Define FileSplit for test and train by providing from File Path,Allowed Formats, and Random Number to FileSplit

```
FileSplit train = new FileSplit(trainData, NativeImageLoader.ALLOWED_FORMATS,randNumGen);
        FileSplit test = new FileSplit(testData,NativeImageLoader.ALLOWED_FORMATS,randNumGen);
```

# Lab Step 9:

Create a Parent Path Label Generator to take the directory name as the label for the image. 

```
ParentPathLabelGenerator labelMaker = new ParentPathLabelGenerator();
```

# Lab Step 10:

Create a RecordReader and pass it height, width, channels, and LabelMaker.

```
ImageRecordReader recordReader = new ImageRecordReader(height,width,channels,labelMaker);
```

# Lab Step 11:

Initialize the recordreaders. 

recordReader.initialize(train);

# Lab Step 12:
# Lab Step 13:
